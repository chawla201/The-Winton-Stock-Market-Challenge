# The-Winton-Stock-Market-Challenge
[Winton Stock Market Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-winton-stock-market-challenge/overview) was a competition hosted by Winton on Kaggle in 2016.
The main task of this competition was predict the interday and intraday return of a stock, given the history of the past few days.
Along with the challenging task of predicting stock returns, the challenge also included tasks such as handling missing data, identifying categorical data, and extracting useful features for better predictions.
A simple feed forward multi layer perceptron regressor model was used as the estimator in the MultiOutputRegressor.
